def dice_loss(y_true, y_pred, smooth=1):
    """Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) loss.

    Essentially 1 minus the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Here, the Dice
    similarity coefficient is used as a metric to evaluate the performance of
    image segmentation by comparing spatial overlap between the true and
    predicted spaces.

    A smoothing factor, which is by default 1, is applied to avoid dividing by
    zeros.

    Dice loss = 1 - (2 * |X & Y|)/ (X^2 + Y^2)
              = 1 - 2 * sum(A*B) / sum(A^2 + B^2)

    # Arguments
        y_true: The ground truth tensor.
        y_pred: The predicted tensor
        smooth: Smoothing factor. Default is 1.

    # Returns
        The Dice coefficiet loss between the two tensors.
