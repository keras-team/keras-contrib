## Usage of callbacks

A callback is a set of functions to be applied at given stages of the training procedure. You can use callbacks to get a view on internal states and statistics of the model during training. You can pass a list of callbacks (as the keyword argument `callbacks`) to the `.fit()` method of the `Sequential` or `Model` classes. The relevant methods of the callbacks will then be called at each stage of the training.
